# Understand the Problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are trhe inputs?
3. What are the expected outputs?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?

    > Do I have enough information to solve the problem?

5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Exploring Concrete Examples

1. Start with simple examples.
2. Progress to more complex examples.
3. Explore examples with empty inputs.
4. Explore examples with invalid inputs.

## Break it Down

1. Explicitly write out the steps you would take.

## Solve/Simplify

### Simplify

1. Find the core difficulty in what your trying to do.
2. Temporarily ignore that difficulty.
3. Write a simplified solution.
4. Then incorporate that difficulty back in.

### Solve

## Look Back and Refactor

- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
- Can you improve the performance of the solution?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How have others solved this problem?
